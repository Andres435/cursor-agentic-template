# `user/` — Recommended Cursor user profile (per machine)

Templates for `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\`. These are **not** applied automatically when you
`git pull` — Cursor keeps settings outside the workspace.

| File | Applies to |
|---|---|
| `settings.recommended.json` | Multi-repo / worktree SCM, review-then-stage, C# open-file diagnostics (no auto-load of every solution) |
| `keybindings.recommended.json` | Hunk stage / multi-diff chords (`Ctrl+Alt+D/A/N/P/G`) |
