# Agentic proof

Verify receipts and review stamps live in the local, gitignored manifest, so a PR pipeline cannot see
them and the push gate only covers pushes through Claude, Cursor, or the git `pre-push` hook. The proof
is a one-line commit trailer that lets anyone confirm a commit's work was verified and reviewed.

**Status: advisory.** The writer and verifier exist and are tested; no product repo pipeline enforces
it yet (that needs each team to accept the step, and a way to ship the verifier into each repo).

## Format

```text
Agentic-Proof: v1 fp=<64 hex> verify=pass evidence=<12 hex or none> review=<ready|ready-with-fixes>
```

- `fp` is the SHA-256 fingerprint of the commit's own diff against its first parent, hashed exactly like
  a stamp ([ManifestFields.ps1](../scripts/ticket/lib/ManifestFields.ps1): fpVersion 2 canonical diff args).
  The staged diff taken just before `git commit` is byte-identical to that commit's diff, so the writer
  uses it. It is the diff, not the commit SHA, because a commit cannot contain its own hash.
- `evidence` is the first 12 hex of the verify receipt's evidence SHA-256 (`Set-VerifyReceipt.ps1 -Evidence`), or `none`.
- `review` is the stamp verdict (`Ready`, `Ready with fixes`). `Not ready` and `No change` produce no proof.

## What may leave the machine

Only hashes and verdict words: a diff hash, a 12-character evidence prefix, `pass`, `ready`. No ticket
text, titles, paths, code, repo names, or manifest content.

## Write and verify

- **Write** (prep-pr, before the commit, with the work staged): `Get-AgenticProof.ps1 -Ticket WI<n> -Repo <repo>`
  prints the line. It refuses unless the verify receipt and review stamp both describe the staged work.
  Put the line in the commit message as the last trailer.
- **Verify** (anywhere, one file, no repo dependencies): `Assert-AgenticProof.ps1 -RepoPath <repo> [-Commit <sha>]
  [-Base <ref>] [-Require]`. It picks the newest first-parent non-merge commit in the range (a merged-in base
  branch is skipped), recomputes `fp` from that commit's diff, and compares. A present but invalid or
  mismatched trailer always fails. A missing trailer is `[INFO]` and exits 0 unless `-Require`.

## Limits

- **Self-asserted.** The same local scripts write it, so it proves "the process ran on this diff", not that
  it is tamper-proof; anyone can hand-write a matching line for a diff they did not verify. Signing with a
  shared secret would close this and is out of scope for now.
- Only the newest work commit is checked. Earlier commits in a multi-commit PR are not.
- A squash merge replaces the commits; verify before the squash (on the PR source commit).

## Azure Pipelines step (for a product repo's `ci.yml`)

Not yet adopted by any product repo, and untested in a real pipeline. Copy `Assert-AgenticProof.ps1` into
the repo (for example `.azuredevops/scripts/`) and add to PR validation. The PR build checks out a merge
commit, whose first parent is the target branch, so verify the source commit explicitly:

```yaml
- checkout: self
  fetchDepth: 0
- pwsh: |
    git fetch origin "$(System.PullRequest.TargetBranchName)"
    ./.azuredevops/scripts/Assert-AgenticProof.ps1 -RepoPath . `
      -Commit "$(System.PullRequest.SourceCommitId)" -Base "origin/$(System.PullRequest.TargetBranchName)"
  displayName: Agentic proof
  condition: eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')
```

Run it without `-Require` first: a PR from someone who does not use this workflow then gets an `[INFO]`
instead of a failure. Add `-Require` once the team agrees to enforce it.
