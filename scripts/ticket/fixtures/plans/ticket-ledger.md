# Ticket ledger

One row per closed ticket. Written by `scripts/Update-TicketLedger.ps1` at
`/complete-task` -- do not hand-edit, the script owns this format.

This replaces the per-ticket `WI<n>-closeout.md` files. Durable *lessons* live in
[closeout-index.md](../../../../plans/closeout-index.md); a full closeout page is written only when a
retrospective earns one. Scorecard scale 1-5 (5 = excellent). `CtxS%` is the
/start-ticket chat, `CtxR%` is `/review-changes`, `Ctx%` is `/complete-task`.
`/implement` is not recorded. Do not backfill old rows.
