# User manual

Day-to-day ticket workflow for humans. Agents: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). First clone: run
`/start-new-project` (fills [profile.json](profile.json) and [CUSTOMIZE.md](CUSTOMIZE.md)), then
`/onboard` for the machine script ([MACHINE-SETUP.md](MACHINE-SETUP.md)). After that, commands run
from the profile and do not re-ask for repos or start commands.

Branch mode is three chats. `/start-ticket`, `/review-changes`, and `/complete-task` each load their playbook and the tier contract.

| Chat | Type | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `/start-ticket <ticket> bug\|feature\|spike` | The change is in the working tree. |
| 2 | `/review-changes` | Clean ticket files are staged and the set has a verdict. |
| 3 | `/complete-task`, then `/prep-pr` after you approve | Only the actions you approved ran. |

`/start-stack` runs the local apps. It is not a chat. If chat 1 runs out of context, open a fresh
chat and type `/implement <ticket>`: the approved plan is already on disk.

In Claude Code, commands are namespaced (`/agentic:start-ticket`). After changing plugin files,
commit and update the plugin: Claude reads a snapshot, not the working tree
([adapters/claude/README.md](adapters/claude/README.md)).

## Before you start

1. Open the workspace root (the folder that contains this one), not this folder alone.
2. Confirm `/` lists `start-ticket` **once**.
3. Pass the ticket id on every command that takes one (`TICKET-42`, not a paragraph).
4. Type slash commands. Free-form "please start this ticket" skips intake, branch setup, and the plan.

`/start-ticket` also searches prior closeouts (`plans/closeout-index.md`) and puts matching lessons on
the manifest as `priorFindings`, at most eight. The plan names each id and what it changed.

## Ticket lifecycle

```text
Chat 1 — Plan and build
  /start-ticket <ticket> bug|feature|spike
  Deep tier drafts the plan. Question it; it revises only the section you asked about.
  Say "approved" in chat. Approval is that statement, never an IDE button.
  It writes the plan, then builds in this same chat. Each Work Plan step's [low]|[med]|[high]
  tag sets its tier.
  /start-stack <ticket>   when you need the local apps
  Done when: the change is in your working tree

Chat 2 — Review
  /review-changes         new chat; reviews ticket files, stages the clean ones, stamps the verdict

Chat 3 — Close
  /complete-task          new chat; skips review-diff when chat 2 was Ready on the same staged set
  You review the approval package.
  /prep-pr                only after you approve
  Then three short questions (did the plan hold? any friction? anything durable?). It writes only
  what you pick. One ledger row is the only automatic output.
```

Later PR feedback: new chat, `/address-pr-comments <ticket>`. A coworker's PR: `/peer-review <id>`.

**Close gate.** Close fails until each affected repo has a passing verify receipt and a review stamp
whose reviewed work is still what got committed. A base-branch merge before push is fine. Any
other commit after the review means `/review-changes` again. A spike skips both.

### Engineering mode

`/start-ticket`, `/review-changes`, and `/complete-task` each load their playbook and the tier
contract. Pin this for ad-hoc work, or for a long chat that should stay an orchestrator after
compaction. How to pin it is in your IDE's adapter ([Cursor](adapters/cursor/model-usage.md),
[Claude Code](adapters/claude/model-usage.md)). Say "exit engineering mode" to turn it off. Typing
`/engineering-mode` and a ticket command in one message attaches only the first skill.

```text
Engineering mode on — orchestrator: <model> (<tier>)
step N/M [<tag>] → inline | lane (<model>)
```

### Worktree mode (opt-in)

Only when `profile.worktreeSupported` is true and your overlay ships the worktree scripts. Add
`--worktree` to run a ticket beside another one. That is four chats: plan, `/implement` in the
ticket window, review, close. Later commands read the mode from the manifest.

## Commands

| You want | Type |
| --- | --- |
| Fill the profile for a new project | `/start-new-project` |
| Machine setup after the profile exists | `/onboard` |
| Pin model routing for the chat | `/engineering-mode` |
| Health check (profile, hooks, gates, lanes) | `/doctor` |
| Start a ticket | `/start-ticket <ticket> bug\|feature\|spike` |
| Build the approved plan (resume / worktree) | `/implement <ticket>` |
| Run the local apps | `/start-stack <ticket>` |
| Give the stack to another ticket / stop it | `/swap-stack <ticket>` / `/stop-stack` |
| Review ticket files; stage the clean ones | `/review-changes` |
| Closeout and approval package | `/complete-task` |
| Commit / push / PR / tracker write-back, after you approve | `/prep-pr` |
| Address PR comments | `/address-pr-comments <ticket>` |
| Peer-review a coworker's PR | `/peer-review <id>` |

`bug-fix`, `feature-plan`, and `tech-spike` are plan shapes `/start-ticket` reads, not commands.

### What "done" means

| Command | Done when | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/start-ticket` | Artifact gate passes; plan approved; build continues in the same chat | New chat `/review-changes` |
| `/implement` | Work Plan steps complete, tests run | New chat `/review-changes`, then `/complete-task` |
| `/review-changes` | Verdict on screen and `reviewReady` stamped | New chat `/complete-task` |
| `/start-stack` | Script printed URLs, or `[FAIL]` after one recycle | You use the apps |
| `/complete-task` | Approval package is on screen; verify receipt written | You approve, then `/prep-pr` |
| `/prep-pr` | Only the actions you approved ran | Retrospective, then stop |
| `/peer-review` | Draft on screen; after approval, comments posted | Stop |

## Models (tiers)

| Work | Tier |
| --- | --- |
| Drafting the plan | deep |
| `[low]` / `[med]` / `[high]` steps | fast / standard / deep |
| Subagents: explore, branch, verify | fast |
| Subagents: review | standard (plus a deep second opinion when the plan has a `[high]` step) |

Each adapter maps tiers to real models: [Cursor](adapters/cursor/model-usage.md),
[Cursor GPT chat](adapters/gpt/model-usage.md), [Claude Code](adapters/claude/model-usage.md),
[Codex](adapters/codex/model-usage.md).

## Local apps

One stack at a time. `/start-stack <ticket>` runs `profile.stacks.startCommand`. When it fails with
"another ticket owns the stack", "port in use", or leftover processes, run `/stop-stack`, then
`/start-stack <ticket>` once. If it still fails, fix the machine yourself; do not ask the agent to
inspect ports.

The agent does not open the browser on its own. Ask for a smoke pass ("smoke test the UI"). It asks
you whether it passed and stamps Tested only if you approve. Review and closeout show Never tested /
Tested / Untested latest changes. Close never needs it.

## Staging and review

The staged set is the approval record. Stage hunks yourself, then `/review-changes` or
`/complete-task`. Unstaged work is awareness only unless you include it.

## Done table

| Phase | Artifact | Script gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start | `plans/<ticket>-manifest.json`, `plans/<ticket>-<type>-plan.md` (Plan Digest + Engineering Decisions) | `Assert-TicketArtifacts -Phase start` |
| Review | `reviewReady` (verdict, headSha, fingerprint) + `ctxPct.review` on the manifest | `Set-ReviewReady` / `Set-TicketCtxPct` |
| Close | `verify` on the manifest (pass per repo), review still matching, ledger row | `Assert-TicketArtifacts -Phase close` |
