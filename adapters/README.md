# `adapters/` — Per-runtime overlays

The repo root names verbs and tiers. Each adapter's `model-usage.md` maps tiers, subagent roles,
and `deepLane`. Verbs: [../_shared/harness-verbs.md](../_shared/harness-verbs.md).

| Adapter | Runtime | `deepLane` |
|---|---|---|
| [cursor/](cursor/README.md) | Cursor | dispatch |
| [claude/](claude/README.md) | Claude Code | dispatch |
| [gpt/](gpt/model-usage.md) | Cursor chat on a GPT picker | inline |
| [codex/](codex/README.md) | Codex | inline |

Hook logic lives once in [`../hooks/core/`](../hooks/core/). `cursor/hooks/` and `claude/hooks/` are thin adapters over it.

## External lanes (optional)

A user can add another vendor's read-only CLI as an extra lane for the architect panel and the
review second opinion. Copy [../user/external-lanes.example.json](../user/external-lanes.example.json) to
`user/external-lanes.local.json` (gitignored) and edit it: each entry has a `name`, `family`, an argv
`command`, `readOnly: true`, and an optional `timeoutSec`. [Invoke-ExternalLane.ps1](../scripts/ticket/Invoke-ExternalLane.ps1)
runs it with the prompt on stdin and accepts the reply only when its first line is `model: <x>` and
`<x>` starts with the entry's `family`; anything else is a one-line dropout, never a substitute
model ([rule 8](../_shared/model-routing.md#dispatch-rules)). Nothing runs unless the user asks for a panel
(`--panel` or "with panel"). The shipped Codex entry is an untested example.

## Open a ticket worktree

A worktree ticket's chat must be rooted at the ticket worktree: the `root` that
`scripts/ticket/Resolve-TicketRoot.ps1 -Ticket <ticket> -Json` returns. Shared docs say only that;
how to get there depends on the runtime.

| Runtime | How |
|---|---|
| Cursor | Open the ticket's workspace file (or the worktree folder) and start a new Agent chat in that window. Never call `move_agent_to_root`: Cursor cannot root an agent on a folder of several git repos. |
| Claude Code | Start `claude` (with `--plugin-dir` pointing at this folder) in the worktree root, or change directory there first. |
| Codex | Start Codex in the worktree root. |
